        <h2>-- About Me --</h2>
        <p>Salutations! My name is Jose Armando and I'm a beginner in Full-Stack Engineering. I took 
            insterest in this because I enjoy technology and the design aspect of it behind the scenes.  
            I am one of the first in my family to pursue a career in software development. What can I say I'm just 
            good with technology.</p> 

        <p>During my free time I do enjoy sketching and painting, whether it's with pen and paper or digitally in photoshop. 
            I'm always on the go so I try to take advantage of the opportunity whenevr I can! Beside coding and art, other past 
            times I also enjoy are: exercising whether at the gym or going for jog, hanging out with friends/coworkers, and discovering 
            new spots to eat/drink/relax.</p>

            <p>While learning Javascript, in one of my lessons I was taught on how to create a message generator.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/J-Ferr/ASICS-RUN.git" target="_blank">ASICS PROJECT CODING</a>
            <p>While learning about HTML and CSS one of they projects they had us working on was to build a site on a brand we really to a liking to.
                I decided to built a site about the running company ASICS. I've worked for the company for almost 2 years once this August hits and I've 
                learned so much about shoes than I ever knew before. This was also right before I started to learn anything about Javascript, so all of 
                the coding that was used was just HTML and CSS.
